The art of Full Catastrophe Living

Starting the 27th of September, Student Meditation organises an 8-week mindfulness course for students taking place at Science Park.

**What?**
We will teach the program of the famous Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. This is a course that is high in intensity. It is eight weeks long and consists of weekly 2.5h group sessions in which we do guided meditations, discussions and exercises together. Between the sessions, participants are asked to do daily homework exercises that take around 45 minutes.

**Why?**
Life can be stressful and unpredictable. Difficulties and challenges are inevitable parts of it. Learning to work with this knowledge, and developing the skill to live life fully, in all its richness, is what Jon Kabat-Zinn calls *Full Catastrophe Living*. This is what the practice of mindfulness is all about.

In the MBSR course we practice to:
- relate to stress and difficult feelings in more helpful ways,
- worry less,
- become more aware of our patterns in thinking, behaviour and mood,
- and be more present and aware in day-to-day life.

Since the development of the MBSR course, research has shown that the MBSR course has positive impact on both mental and physical health in various ways. 

**For whom?**
We are teaching this course for students. It does not matter whether you study at the UVA or somewhere else.

This is an intensive course with weekly 2.5h sessions and daily homework practice of around 45 minutes. Please only sign up for this course if you're able to make this kind of time commitment.

**Where & When**?
The course will be taught at Science Park on Tuesday evenings from 17:30-20:00 for 8 weeks starting the 27th of September.

**Costs**
The costs of this course will be 60 euros. We don't want money to be a reason that you cannot follow this course. If you are not able to pay, please contact us to figure out a solution.
