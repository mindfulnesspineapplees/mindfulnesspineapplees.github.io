<h1>Optimal giving</h1>
<h3>Our purpose</h3>

<p>This website is here to build a community of like-minded people who want to have a positive impact in an effective way (so using rationality and science).
  In this community you can do projects together, learn about all sorts of topics, meet new people, get inspired by each other, and do all sorts of fun activities!</p>
  
  <p>We want to provide a space in which people can grow, let their creativity flurish, get to know about and develop their own skills and passions,
    and be able to look back with pride, joy and excitement at the time spent here.
  This means that our projects don't have to necesarily have postive impact on society, as it might instead enahnce any of the just mentioned traits.</p>

  <p>We want this community to be a place where you can build a network of people with a common goal: make the world a better place.
    
 <h3>Effective altruistic?</h3>
  <p>In our community we have a common vision that we would like to do good in an effective way. This does look a lot like effective altruism.
  We've noticed, however, that there are many people who appreciate the art of rationality and the scientific method and would like to use that to do good effectively
  but at the same time disagree or be skeiptical about EA. This, while in practice both parties most likely would take the exact same actions and want the same things!
  So it would be a shame to miss out on so many people who could be an amazing part of this community!</p>
