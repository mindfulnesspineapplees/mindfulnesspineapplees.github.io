# Mindfulness Course
Here we have a mission to give the MBSR course to students! MBSR (stands for mindfulness based stress reduction) is an 8 week program that is currently the most researched meditation technique out there.

## What does the research show?
This course has effect on many aspects of well-being
* Stress reduction
* Depression prevention
* Acceptance of pain

Just the name a few big things!

# Who are we?
We are a team of (officially certified) MBSR-teachers who want to spread this tool of well-being to both students and organizations of which we think they are trying to have an effective positive impact, because we would love these two groups to have more well-being and resilliance.
